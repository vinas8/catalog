# Serpent Town Project Instructions for AI Assistants

## 👋 New Session Greeting

**When starting a NEW session (first user message), greet with:**

```
👋 Welcome to Serpent Town v0.5.0!

Quick commands:
  .smri  - Complete project briefing (tree, docs, API)
  lol    - Random programming joke 😄

Type a command or tell me what you need!
```

**RULES:**
- Only show greeting on FIRST user message of session
- If user types `.smri` or `lol` immediately, execute that command instead
- Keep greeting concise (3 lines max)
