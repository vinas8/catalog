# Godot Farming Game Tutorial Series

## Tutorial Source
**YouTube Playlist:** https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a&si=sREWspajKQlKFQGa

## Goal
Clone/improve upon Stardew Valley-type farming game mechanics using Godot engine.

## Key Features to Implement
- Farming mechanics (planting, watering, harvesting)
- Animal husbandry (similar to current snake breeding system)
- Day/night cycle
- Seasonal changes
- Crafting system
- NPC interactions
- Shop/economy system

## Current Snake Muffin Assets to Leverage
- **Existing game mechanics:** Tamagotchi-style care system (hunger, water, health, etc.)
- **Shop system:** Product catalog, Stripe payments
- **Collection management:** User inventory system
- **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers + KV storage

## Integration Strategy
- Keep existing snake breeding as one "farm animal" type
- Add farming crops/vegetables
- Expand care mechanics to include farming tasks
- Reuse shop/payment infrastructure
- Add Godot-inspired game loop and visuals

## Status
📝 Planning phase - tutorial series identified

## Next Steps
1. Watch tutorial series and take notes on key mechanics
2. Map tutorial features to existing Snake Muffin architecture
3. Design integration plan (Godot features → JavaScript/HTML5)
4. Implement farming mechanics alongside snake care
