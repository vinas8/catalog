# Enable Worker Route/Trigger

You're at the worker settings page. Now enable the workers.dev route:

## Steps:

1. **Click "Settings" tab** (should already be there)

2. **Click "Triggers" in left sidebar**

3. **Look for "Routes" section** 

4. **Enable workers.dev subdomain:**
   - Should see option to "Add route" or "Enable workers.dev"
   - Click it
   - It will activate: `catalog.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev`

5. **Copy the URL** that appears

## Alternative:

If you see "Domains" or "Routes" - click "Add route" and select "workers.dev"

## What It Should Look Like:

```
Routes
├─ Workers.dev route: ✅ Enabled
│  └─ catalog.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
└─ Custom domains: (none)
```

Tell me the URL once you see it! 🚀
