# Serpent Town - Claude Instructions

## 🚨 WHEN USER TYPES `.smri`:

**IMMEDIATELY RUN** (no explanation needed):

```bash
bash scripts/smri-startup.sh
```

Everything you need (context, rules, commands, syntax) is in the script output.

**DO NOT:**
- Ask user first
- Manually load INDEX.md, README.md, package.json
- Explain what you're doing

**JUST RUN THE SCRIPT.**
