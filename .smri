## NOTATION STANDARD v2.1

Format: S{M}.{RRR}.{II}

Components:
  S   = Scenario prefix
  M   = Primary module (1-6, lower = more important)
  RRR = Relations (comma-separated, includes ALL dependencies)
  II  = Instance number (01-99, zero-padded)

Module Priority (Lower = More Critical):
  1 = Shop      → HIGHEST (revenue)
  2 = Game      → HIGH (engagement)
  3 = Auth      → MEDIUM (security)
  4 = Payment   → HIGH (Stripe)
  5 = Worker    → MEDIUM (infrastructure)
  6 = Common    → LOW (utilities)

External Services (using 5-x notation):
  5-1 = Cloudflare KV
  5-2 = Stripe Webhooks
  5-3 = Stripe API
  5-4 = GitHub Pages

Notation Rules:
  - Commas (,) separate ALL dependencies (internal + external)
  - External services use hyphen notation (5-1, 5-2, etc.)
  - Primary module ALWAYS included in relations
  - List ALL touched systems in RRR

CORRECT Examples:
  S6.1,2,3,4,5,6,5-1,5-2.03   → Health Check tests ALL (6 modules + KV + Stripe)
  S5.5,5-1,5-2.01             → Worker + KV + Stripe Webhooks
  S1.1,5-1.01                 → Shop + KV

WRONG Examples:
  S6.5-11.1-12.03   ❌ Missing internal modules
  S5.11.2-12.2.01   ❌ Old notation (11, 12 deprecated)

## 🎯 BUSINESS RULES (Extracted from docs)

### Revenue Model
- Real snakes sold via Stripe (€80-€1000+)
- Virtual snakes = free (demo mode, currently disabled)
- Equipment shop uses in-game gold (earned through care)

### Purchase Flow
1. User visits catalog.html
2. System generates 32+ char user hash → localStorage
3. Click "Buy Now" → Stripe Checkout (client_reference_id={hash})
4. Payment complete → Webhook fires
5. Worker validates signature → writes to KV
6. User redirected → success.html → register → game.html

### Ownership
- Snake assigned to user via Stripe webhook
- Stored in KV: USER_PRODUCTS namespace (user:{hash})
- Product marked sold in PRODUCT_STATUS (product:{id})
- Owner verification via Worker API: /user-products?user={hash}

### Product Status
- available = can buy
- sold = owned by someone, hidden from catalog
- KV is single source of truth (no local JSON in production)

### Data Sources
- Production: Cloudflare Worker API (/products)
- Development: Worker API + JSON fallback (offline only)
- DEPRECATED: data/products.json (not used)

## DETAILED SCENARIO SPECS

### S6.1,2,3,4,5,6,5-1,5-2.03: System Health Check
Priority: P0.7 (CRITICAL)
Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
Location: /debug.html

Tests ALL systems:
  1 = Shop (product catalog display)
  2 = Game (game state, stats)
  3 = Auth (user hash)
  4 = Payment (Stripe links)
  5 = Worker (API connectivity)
  6 = Common (utilities)
  5-1 = Cloudflare KV (product count)
  5-2 = Stripe (webhook endpoints)

Flow:
  1. Auto-runs after 1s on /debug.html
  2. Pings Worker → tests latency
  3. Calls /products → counts items from KV (5-1)
  4. Verifies UI components (8 tabs/divs)
  5. Checks switchModule() function
  6. Tests LocalStorage
  7. Displays color-coded results

Business Value:
  - Reduces debug time from 10+ min to < 30 sec
  - Works in Termux/proot (no DevTools needed)
  - Catches issues immediately

### S1.1,2,3,4,5.01: Happy Path Purchase
Priority: P0.0 (HIGHEST)
Status: 🚧 IN PROGRESS
Location: /smri/scenarios/S1.1,2,3,4,5.01.html

Tests purchase flow across 5 modules:
  1 = Shop (catalog display, Stripe links)
  2 = Game (snake appears with stats)
  3 = Auth (hash generation, validation)
  4 = Payment (Stripe checkout, webhook)
  5 = Worker (webhook processing, KV writes)

External services used (implicit):
  5-1 = KV (stores user products, product status)
  5-2 = Stripe Webhooks (checkout.session.completed)

Flow (15 steps):
  1. Visit catalog.html
  2. Generate user hash (32+ chars) → localStorage
  3. Click "Buy Now" Ball Python (€450)
  4. Stripe checkout opens (client_reference_id={hash})
  5. Complete payment
  6. Webhook fires → POST /stripe-webhook
  7. Worker validates signature (5-2)
  8. Worker writes USER_PRODUCTS KV (5-1)
  9. Worker marks product sold in PRODUCT_STATUS (5-1)
  10. Redirect to success.html?session_id={ID}
  11. Success page polls /user-products (max 20 tries)
  12. Snake found → show "Register Now"
  13. Click Register → register.html
  14. Submit username → Worker saves USERS KV
  15. Redirect to game.html → snake appears!

Business Rules:
  - Hash persists across pages
  - Product disappears from catalog when sold
  - Snake has initial stats (hunger=100, health=100)
  - Webhook must complete within 20s

Assertions:
  assert(localStorage.getItem('serpent_last_purchase_hash') === userHash)
  assert(KV['user:' + userHash].length === 1)
  assert(KV['product:prod_xxx'].status === 'sold')
  assert(gameSnakes.length === 1)
